modern.css was created in 2014 by Alyx Mayer and used experimentally with
Lenin's Materialism and Empiriocriticism, which was  converted to html5. That
archive currently uses a local copy of modern.css,

An extension of this stylesheet called modern-britdem.css is used for the
archive of 18th Century British radicals (history/england/britdem)
